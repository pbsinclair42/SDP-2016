# Technical Specification

## Purpose

Build a robot which can play football with other like robots.

The arduino receives its orders over a serial RTF connection.. The RTF is set to the same frequency as the arduino board. A single character is send via this connection. We have written a case statement that checks for the characters F, B, L, S, â€¦  which make the robot move in a certain way.

## Naming Conventions and Terminology


## Facts and Assumptions

## The environment

There is a football pitch with a camera above it. This camera feeds into the laboratory next door so it can be watched. There are 10cm high walls around the pitch and white masking tape will indicate the pitch markings.

## The competition
Each robot must have a flat board on top of it. This board will have coloured circles on it. This is to make it possible for on lookers to tell which robot is which and to let the autonomous robots know where they and their surroundings are.
