# To integrate vision
Go to your local version of this repo in the terminal. Then
do `git clone https://github.com/uoe-sdp-3b/group3-4-vision/`
and then `ln -s SDP-2016/vision ./vision`

If that doesn't work, get down on your knees and pray to the gods of stack overflow.

# To run
Find your `SDP-2016/vision` folder and write `python sender.py -t bright_blue -b red -p 1` in terminal to start the camera, then, in a different terminal, go to `SDP-2016/planning` and do `python strategy.py`.
