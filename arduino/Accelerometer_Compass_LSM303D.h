   Summary:
   Show how to calculate level and tilt-compensated heading using
   the snazzy LSM303DLH 3-axis magnetometer/3-axis accelerometer.
   
   Firmware:
   You can set the accelerometer's full-scale range by setting
   the SCALE constant to either 2, 4, or 8. This value is used
   in the initLSM303() function. For the most part, all other
   registers in the LSM303 will be at their default value.
   
   Use the write() and read() functions to write
   to and read from the LSM303's internal registers.
   
   Use getLSM303_accel() and getLSM303_mag() to get the acceleration
   and magneto values from the LSM303. You'll need to pass each of
   those functions an array, where the data will be stored upon
   return from the void.
   
   getHeading() calculates a heading assuming the sensor is level.
   A float between 0 and 360 is returned. You need to pass it a
   array with magneto values. 
   
   getTiltHeading() calculates a tilt-compensated heading.
   A float between 0 and 360 degrees is returned. You need
   to pass this function both a magneto and acceleration array.
   
   Headings are calculated as specified in AN3192:
