To calibrate the compass: 

1. Open the arduino code and go to the main loop function. There you can find:

199: pollAccComp();
200: // calibrateCompass();

2. Comment out the first one - uncomment out the second one;

3. Then, take the robot to a non-EM interference area (E.G. Away from computers and fastly moving robots, preferably the center of the pitch. DON'T tilt it!)


4. slowly rotate it 360 degrees in either direction (preferably both)

 
5. it will then print out the correct biasing values which you can change in the arduino code, revert to the correct version and have a well-calibrated compass. The values you need to change are MAG_OFFSET_X, MAG_OFFSET_Y, MAG_OFFSET_Z in the top defines. Then, undo the changes in step one, and reprogram the arduino

Note:
If you're doing it with a USB cable - use the long one we have, not the short one otherwise - I have added a compass-listener in firmware which you can use with RF - it simply reads serial ascii and prints it out (you can also do this with the serial monitor and the rf stick)
